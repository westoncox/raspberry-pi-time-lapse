Pi USB Drive Setup
# How to mount a USB drive on a Raspberry Pi (on boot, using fstab)
# This file is a paraphrase of this youtube video tutorial:
# https://youtu.be/eQZdPlMH-X8?si=Tf1V-RzufNVzVFlX

# IMPORTANT 1: After completing these steps to set up a USB drive to mount with boot,
if you decide to later RE-partition that USB drive, be sure to update the fstab file
# with the new UUIDâ€”-otherwise the Pi will NOT complete boot.

# IMPORTANT 2: Pi cannot power most spinning hard drives (HDDs) via its USB bus.
# For HDDs, you need a powered USB hub or "desktop" drive.
# USB flash drives and SSDs are ok. I don't know whether "desktop" drive means 2.5" HDD.

# UNMOUNT THE USB DRIVE FIRST!
# UNMOUNT THE USB DRIVE FIRST!
# UNMOUNT THE USB DRIVE FIRST!
# If you don't UNMOUNT THE USB DRIVE FIRST, you WILL have to START OVER.
# UNMOUNT THE USB DRIVE FIRST!
# UNMOUNT THE USB DRIVE FIRST!
# UNMOUNT THE USB DRIVE FIRST!

# STEP 1.) Type the line (below) in Terminal & press ENTER/RETURN.
# This is how you will approach all the following instructions.
# You will type every line WITHOUT a "#" at the beginning.
# None of the rest of the steps are numbered, but you're a smart cookie, you got this!

sudo fdisk -l

# Look for "Disk /dev/sda". Your drive may not be sda (might be sdb).
# Terminology: "dev"=device & "sda"=storage device a.

sudo fdisk /dev/sda

# Welcome to fdisk. Be careful. "d" deletes partition.
# Delete all the partitions by pressing "d" then "enter". (There might be only one partition).

d

# Type "n" to create a new partition.

n

# After pressing "n" & enter, press enter about 2-3 more times to use defaults for:
# Partition number, First sector, Last sector. (Press "enter" after each question).

# IF you encounter this RED text: "Partition #1 contains a exfat signature",
# just press "y" to remove that exfat signature.
# See your new partition by typing "p".

p

# Commit the changes by pressing "w" for write.

w

# "The partition table has been altered... Syncing disks."
# (This may take a while. Wait for "pi@raspberrypi:~ $" to show up).
# Check to confirm that the changes have been made by typing the following
# (same as the first line you typed earlier)

sudo fdisk -l

# _________________________________________

# MAKE THE FILESYSTEM (ext4)
# You should now see "Disk /dev/sda" and a few lines below that, "Device /dev/sda1".
# The next line will give the drive the filesystem. We will use the Linux filesystem "ext4".
# Terminology: mkfs= make filesystem; -t= type; ext4; /dev/sda1= path to the partition we created.

sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda1

# Press "y" if asked whether to proceed anyway.
# If you FORGOT to UNMOUNT the FILESYSTEM, this is the part where you CRY...
# because you'll (unfortunately) be told the drive is mounted; will not make a filesystem here!
# So IF you get that ERROR, START OVER--but UNMOUNT the drive FIRST this time!
# _________________________________________

# Mount the drive: this creates a place to mount the drive

cd /

# If "cd /"" doesn't work, try "cd .." and "cd .." again to get to "pi@raspberrypi:/ $"

ls
sudo mkdir /mnt/hd1
sudo chown pi:pi /mnt/hd1

# _________________________________________

# The following sets the drive up so that it mounts on boot

sudo blkid

# Find UUID which follows "/dev/sda1" & copy* that UUID string (example: 67F7-A24D...etc.)
# copy the UUID="*"

# Keep the CURRENT Terminal window open, but also open a NEW Terminal window.
Edit the fstab file (which tells the any Linux machine what things to mount when it boots up)

sudo nano /etc/fstab

# In nano, create a new line & type the following. *paste the UUID you just copied.
"defaults" are for Permissions. Extra arguments are extra nerdy, so just use "0 1".

UUID=* /mnt/hd1 ext4 defaults,nofail 0 1

# Ctrl X to exit nano, y to save the fstab file, Enter to write the fstab file.

# _________________________________________

# Test what you've done by typing the following two lines:

sudo mount -a
lsblk

# You SHOULD see partition "sda1" at MOUNTPOINT "/mnt/hd1" on drive "sda".
# IF YOU DO NOT see "sda1" at "/mnt/hd1" on "sda', make sure to mount the drive with gparted, then run "lsblk" again.
# "cd" into "/mnt/hd1", then "ls" to see contents (should be "lost+found").

cd /mnt/hd1
ls

# Make sure it works by creating a file in hd1 by typing "touch". Name the file "test".

touch test

#You'll get "permission denied". To get permission, go up a directory "cd .."

cd ..
ls

# You should see "hd1".
# "sudo chmod" to change modification rights. "-R" for recursive
# 777 for read/write/execute permissions for everybody. "hd1" for location.

sudo chmod -R 777 hd1

# _________________________________________

# Try to write test file again:

cd hd1/
ls

# should show the folder "lost+found".

touch test
ls

# should now show "lost+found" and "test".

lsblk

# You SHOULD see partition "sda1" at MOUNTPOINT "/mnt/hd1" on drive "sda".
# IF YOU DO NOT see "sda1" at "/mnt/hd1" on "sda',
# make sure to mount the drive with gparted, then run "lsblk" again.
# For more info, try the following:

df -h
# and/or
sudo fdisk -l

# THE END
